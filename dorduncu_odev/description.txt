Yönergeler
Understand how Word2Vec learns semantic similarity, apply a tutorial, and evaluate results.
Expected Steps
Read or identify example sentences (dataset attached)
Tokenization
Train the Word2Vec model
Print the top 10 most similar words for keywords (e.g., "university", "teacher", "student", "learning")
Delivery
Top 10 similar words for each keyword
Vector for the word "student" (first 10 numbers)
Using PCA or another methods visualize word vectors in 2-D
Analysis
Choose a test word. Do the 3 nearest neighbors make semantic sense? Explain.
Discuss the role of corpus size (3-5 sentences). You may try other corpuses.
Consider eliminating stop words and retry
Possible to use Gensim Word2Vec model as well (optinal).
